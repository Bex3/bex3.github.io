The Bank was a weekend assignment that allows any number of users to create any number of bank accounts and perform transactions on those bank accounts (including withdrawal, deposits and transfers).
This banking system will also save each user's bank account information to file, so that when they come back their account information will be retrieved automatically. It will also accrue interest on a user's bank account if it's an account of type savings or retirement. 


The Java code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Bex3/PairBank).
