Web Chat Client is a chat application built using Spring that allows users to communicate from client to server as well as send message responses ensuring delivery. This was a weekend project during my time at The Iron Yard. 


The Java code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Bex3/WebChatClientSpring).
