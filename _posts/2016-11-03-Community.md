Community is an invite-only social networking application designed for community organizations such as local networking  organizations, churches, and friend groups. This app was created with another Java developer and an iOS developer in three weeks as our final project. The Java back-end is a set of web services that connect a relational postgres database to the iOS client. 

Both the Java and iOS code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/TIYCodeZero).
