title: Hackathon Project - Event Networking App
---



During an Iron Yard hackathon, we were given the task of creating an event networking app where a user can check in at events. This app uses a relational Postgres database and a set of webservices to connect to the iOS front-end. There were two Java developers and one iOS developer in the group.  

Both the Java and iOS code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/GrumpyCatDevelopmentLLC).
