I transitioned from a customer service role to being a java developer to feed my desire to constantly learn and challenge myself. I am looking for a company that allows me to have varied projects so that I am constantly gaining new skills. I pride myself on my perserverance and versatility. 

### More Information
I'm an animal lover! My household includes 3 dogs and one cat. In my off time, I enjoy amateur photography, listening to music, and learning car mechanic skills from my brother.
