I transitioned from a customer service role to being a java developer to feed my desire to constantly learn and challenge myself. I am looking for a company that allows me to have varied projects so that I am consistently gaining new skills. I pride myself on my perserverance and versatility. 

### More Information
My wife and I have three dogs and one cat, so it's fair to say I have a love for animals! In my off time, I enjoy amateur photography, listening to music, learning car mechanic skills from my brother, and adventures of all varieties.
